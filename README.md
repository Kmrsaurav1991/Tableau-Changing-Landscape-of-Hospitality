# Tableau-Changing-Landscape-of-Hospitality

I'm referring to a Tableau story. concentrated on private housing and the rise of a new generation of tenants as changing Landscape of hospitality/hotel industry. 

Vacation rentals and alternate accommodations are growing faster than hotels. Established players had to adapt as new ways to book travel accommodations and demographics changed and the industry continued to be confused with alternative accommodations. New companies find new ways to place themselves, customers begin to change their travel vision and definition for something more individual, which in turn is a unique experience and lasting memories.

There are the following insights in the story

1. Storytelling  
2. KPIs 
3. Charts, indicators, important insights. 
4. recommendations and opportunities.
